# Verify backticked .swift references in Sources/**/README.md still exist.
#
# Why: per-subsystem READMEs reference Swift files by name (e.g.,
# `MeetingRecordingService.swift`). When code is renamed or deleted,
# those references rot silently. This script runs in CI on every code
# change and fails the build if any reference is broken — making
# drift visible at PR time, when it's cheapest to fix.
#
# Scope: extracts single-backtick tokens ending in `.swift` from each
# README, resolves them against the README's own folder first, then
# falls back to a repo-wide Sources/ search. Paths in fenced code
# blocks (```...```) are also caught, which is fine — they should also
# resolve.
#
# Not in scope: cross-folder relative paths in Markdown links,
# function names like `extractChannelZero(from:)`, event names
# like `engine_started`, or any non-`.swift` reference. The dominant
# drift case is "file got renamed inside the subsystem folder," which
# this script catches.
