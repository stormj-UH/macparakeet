# How to release `macparakeet-cli` through Homebrew

This file lives in the macparakeet repo for reference. The tap repo
itself is a separate GitHub repository at
<https://github.com/moona3k/homebrew-tap>. The usual local clone is
`~/code/homebrew-tap`.

## One-time tap setup (already done)

The tap is live. This section is only for reconstructing the setup or
creating a new tap from scratch.

### 1. Create the tap repo on GitHub

```bash
gh repo create moona3k/homebrew-tap --public \
  --description "Homebrew tap for moona3k packages (macparakeet-cli, ...)"
```

Local clone + initial commit:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moona3k/homebrew-tap ~/code/homebrew-tap
cd ~/code/homebrew-tap
mkdir -p Formula
cp ~/code/macparakeet/scripts/dist/homebrew-tap-scaffold/README.md .
cp ~/code/macparakeet/scripts/dist/homebrew-tap-scaffold/macparakeet-cli.rb Formula/
```

During first-time setup, don't push the tap until the formula points at a
real release tarball and has a real `sha256`.

## Cutting a CLI release

The examples below use the current release version; update it before each
release:

```bash
export VERSION=2.3.1
```

Before building, make sure the source repo is on the commit you intend to
release and the CLI version/docs are already updated:

1. Bump `Sources/CLI/MacParakeetCLI.swift`.
2. Add a semver entry to `Sources/CLI/CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Refresh versioned examples in `README.md`, `integrations/`, and this
   scaffold if user-facing output changes.

### 2. Build the standalone CLI binary

In the macparakeet repo, from the commit you intend to tag:

```bash
swift build -c release --product macparakeet-cli
mkdir -p "dist/macparakeet-cli-${VERSION}-darwin-arm64"
cp .build/release/macparakeet-cli "dist/macparakeet-cli-${VERSION}-darwin-arm64/"
```

### 3. Sign + notarize the binary

Use the same Developer ID identity already set up for the `.app`. The
exact identity is in `scripts/dist/sign_notarize.sh`.

```bash
codesign --sign "Developer ID Application: <YOUR NAME> (<TEAMID>)" \
         --options runtime \
         --timestamp \
         "dist/macparakeet-cli-${VERSION}-darwin-arm64/macparakeet-cli"

# Pack for notarization
ditto -c -k --keepParent "dist/macparakeet-cli-${VERSION}-darwin-arm64" \
      "dist/macparakeet-cli-${VERSION}-darwin-arm64.zip"
shasum -a 256 "dist/macparakeet-cli-${VERSION}-darwin-arm64.zip" \
  | tee "dist/macparakeet-cli-${VERSION}-darwin-arm64.zip.sha256"

# Submit. The notarytool keychain profile name is whatever was set up
# previously (search scripts/dist/ for the actual name).
xcrun notarytool submit "dist/macparakeet-cli-${VERSION}-darwin-arm64.zip" \
      --keychain-profile <profile-name>
```

Poll the returned submission ID with
`xcrun notarytool info <id> --keychain-profile <profile>` until it reads
`Accepted`. Do not use `notarytool submit --wait`; the app release pipeline
avoids it because it can SIGBUS-crash on some macOS/Xcode combinations.

### 4. Tar + checksum

```bash
cd dist
COPYFILE_DISABLE=1 tar -czf "macparakeet-cli-${VERSION}-darwin-arm64.tar.gz" \
        "macparakeet-cli-${VERSION}-darwin-arm64"
shasum -a 256 "macparakeet-cli-${VERSION}-darwin-arm64.tar.gz" \
  | tee "macparakeet-cli-${VERSION}-darwin-arm64.tar.gz.sha256"
# Copy the SHA256 hex into the formula's `sha256` field.
```

### 5. Publish the GitHub release

```bash
gh release create "cli-v${VERSION}" \
  "dist/macparakeet-cli-${VERSION}-darwin-arm64.tar.gz" \
  "dist/macparakeet-cli-${VERSION}-darwin-arm64.tar.gz.sha256" \
  "dist/macparakeet-cli-${VERSION}-darwin-arm64.zip" \
  "dist/macparakeet-cli-${VERSION}-darwin-arm64.zip.sha256" \
  --title "macparakeet-cli ${VERSION}" \
  --notes-file <release-notes.md>
```

Tag pattern: `cli-v<major>.<minor>.<patch>` — keeps CLI tags distinct
from the app's release tags.

### 6. Push the tap

```bash
cd ~/code/homebrew-tap
# Update Formula/macparakeet-cli.rb's version, url, and sha256 values.
git add Formula/macparakeet-cli.rb
git commit -m "macparakeet-cli ${VERSION}"
git push
```

If tap README/caveats changed, update and commit those files in the same tap
release commit.

### 7. Verify end-to-end

```bash
brew update
brew reinstall moona3k/tap/macparakeet-cli

macparakeet-cli --version    # should print ${VERSION}
macparakeet-cli health --json
brew test moona3k/tap/macparakeet-cli
```

For a fully fresh install check, uninstall the formula first and then run
`brew install moona3k/tap/macparakeet-cli`.

## Recurring maintenance

For each subsequent CLI release:

1. Bump `version` in `Sources/CLI/MacParakeetCLI.swift`.
2. Add an entry to `Sources/CLI/CHANGELOG.md` per semver discipline.
3. Repeat steps 2–7 above with the new version number.

Bottle support (faster install via pre-built `.bottle.tar.gz` per macOS
version) is a later phase. Homebrew CI can build bottles automatically;
see `brew tap-new --pull-label` and the Homebrew bottles docs.

## Why this approach

- **Pre-built signed binary** rather than `swift build` in the formula:
  faster install (no ~30s SwiftPM compile), no need for users to have
  Xcode CLT, simpler caveats. Recommended in the canonical plan at
  `plans/completed/cli-as-canonical-parakeet-surface.md`.
- **Tap separate from main repo:** keeps Homebrew's expected layout
  (`Formula/<name>.rb`), allows future formulae (`macparakeet-cli`,
  potentially other tools) to share infrastructure.
- **Keeping FFmpeg + yt-dlp as `depends_on`** rather than bundling:
  smaller release tarball, lets users keep one canonical FFmpeg, lets
  brew handle dep upgrades.
