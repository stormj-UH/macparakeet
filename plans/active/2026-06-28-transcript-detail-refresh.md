# Plan: Transcript Detail Refresh (media-document reading)

> **Executor instructions**: This is the audit's "Move 1" (highest daily-use UI
> value, lowest product ambiguity) from
> [`docs/research/open-source-ui-reference-audit-2026-05.md`](../../docs/research/open-source-ui-reference-audit-2026-05.md).
> The goal is to make `TranscriptResultView` read like a first-class **media
> document** (text-first, time-aware, quiet persistent playback) — not to turn
> it into a Descript-style editor. **Much of Move 1 already ships** (persistent
> `AudioScrubberBar`, auto-scroll-to-active-segment, tap-to-seek, active-line
> highlight, text selection). This plan only closes the genuine gaps and breaks
> up the god-file as it goes. Ship Phase 1 first; it is self-contained and
> view-only.
>
> **Drift check (run first)**:
> ```bash
> git fetch origin
> git diff --stat origin/main -- \
>   Sources/MacParakeet/Views/Transcription/TranscriptResultView.swift \
>   Sources/MacParakeet/Views/Transcription/TranscriptTimestampedContentView.swift \

>   Sources/MacParakeetViewModels/MediaPlayerViewModel.swift
> # Re-confirm the "already exists" claims below before building; if any have
> # changed since 672ee1028 the scope below may already be partly done.

## Status

- **Priority**: P2
- **Effort**: L (staged; Phase 1 is S)
- **Risk**: MED overall — LOW for Phase 1, MED for the find-bar and the
  video-mode rail unification (layout-touching).
- **Depends on**: none. Soft-sequences *after* any in-flight
  `TranscriptResultView` edits to avoid churn (drift-check first).
- **Category**: ui, transcription, library, view-decomposition
- **Planned at**: commit `672ee1028`, 2026-06-28

### Progress

- **Phase 1 — DONE** (commit `e91ca2699`): U1 per-segment hover actions + U4
  reading font-size. `swift build` + full `swift test` green.
- **U2 in-transcript find — DONE** (this branch): testable `TranscriptFindModel`
  (`MacParakeetViewModels`, 17 unit tests) + pinned `TranscriptFindBar` (modeled
  on `SettingsSearchField`, ⌘F focus / ⌘G·⇧⌘G nav / Esc clear-then-close /
  "X of Y" counter) + shared `TranscriptFindHighlight` (`AttributedString`
  accent wash, current match bolded). Works in **both** Timed (per-segment rows,
  scroll by `startMs`) and Text mode (paragraph blocks anchored by line index).
  Find-navigate sets `autoScrollPaused` so playback-follow doesn't fight it.
  Verified: default build, Swift-6 language-mode gate, full `swift test` all
  green. Live GUI eyeball deferred (concurrent agent sessions on this Mac steal
  GUI focus).
- **Remaining**: U3 (one quiet rail in every mode), U5 (finish god-file
  decomposition).

## Why this matters

The transcript detail view is where users land after every file/URL/meeting
transcription — the highest-traffic surface in the app and the moment the audit
frames as "Can I use the transcript effortlessly after it finishes?" Today it
reads like a document page with playback bolted on. Closing the four gaps below
(hover actions, in-transcript search, a consistently-present quiet rail, and
calmer reading density) makes the daily payoff feel finished without adding
product surface area. It also forces a first real decomposition of the
3,166-line `TranscriptResultView` god-file, which every future transcript change
has to fight.

## Summary

Reference-anchored (we looked at these directly): **Descript** — the transcript
*is* the primary surface, media follows the text; **IINA** — playback lives in a
*quiet, hover-revealed rail* woven into the chrome, not a loud control box;
**iOS Apple Podcasts** — calm, readable, line-synced reading (note: *macOS*
Podcasts shows static text, so the synced-reading bar is the iOS reference). Our
view already has the synced split-pane, active-line highlight, tap-to-seek, and
auto-scroll. This plan adds: per-segment **hover actions** (play-from-here, copy,
copy-with-timestamp), **in-transcript find** (⌘F, match highlight, next/prev),
a **quiet playback rail that is always present** (today it is missing in
video-split mode because transport is trapped inside the video frame), and
**reading-density polish** (calmer rows + optional font-size). Each unit
extracts its slice out of the god-file behind a characterization test.

## Scope

### In scope
- Per-segment hover-revealed actions on timestamped transcript rows.
- In-transcript search/find with match highlight and keyboard navigation.
- A single quiet playback rail present in **all** playback modes (including
  video-split), so transport controls are never trapped inside the video frame.
- Reading-density polish: quieter rows for long-form reading + an optional,
  persisted font-size control.
- Incremental, behavior-preserving extraction of the transcript reading pane and
  segment row out of `TranscriptResultView.swift`, each guarded by a
  characterization test.

### Out of scope
- Descript-style **edit-media-by-editing-text** / waveform timeline. We are not
  a media editor; do not build it.
- **Word-level karaoke** highlight. We highlight at segment granularity today;
  word-level is a deferred stretch (see follow-up), partly blocked by data
  (segment timing only — see Invariants).
- Decorative **waveform behind transcript text** and making the transcript
  **card-heavier** — the audit explicitly warns against both.
- Changes to the **Summary / Chat** tabs, export, retranscribe, or meeting
  artifact menus beyond moving code during extraction.
- Cross-meeting / library-wide search (tracked in the meetings-workspace plan).

### Invariants
- **Preserve existing playback behavior**: tap-to-seek (`onTimestampTap`),
  active-segment binary-search highlight, auto-scroll-to-active with the 5s
  manual-scroll pause + >2s seek re-sync, and `.textSelection(.enabled)` must
  all keep working unchanged.
- **Segment timing is start-only.** `TranscriptSegment` has `startMs` and
  **no `endMs`** (`Sources/MacParakeetCore/Utilities/TranscriptSegmenter.swift`).
  Any "current word/segment range" or copy-with-timestamp derives the end from
  the *next* segment's `startMs` (or media duration for the last). Do not invent
  an `endMs` on the model for this feature.
- **All three playback modes keep working**: `.video` (YouTube + sourceURL or
  video file), `.audio` (audio file), `.none` (meeting/local with no media).
  Respect `MediaPlayerViewModel.detectPlaybackMode`. The webm/opus→m4a transcode
  path stays intact (AVFoundation can't decode webm/opus — see
  [[reference_avplayer_codec_limits]]); do not surface a dead transport for
  `.none`.
- **Local-first**: search and all reading affordances are fully offline; no
  network calls added.
- **Coral discipline**: never `.tint(coral)` at hosting roots/sheet wrappers;
  coral cascades only through `parakeetAction`. Use `DesignSystem` tokens
  (`accent`, `surfaceElevated`, `Animation.hoverTransition`, etc.).
- **Swift 6 language-mode clean**; new view-logic that is testable lives in
  `MacParakeetViewModels`, not the view.

## Key technical decisions

- **Extend, don't reinvent.** `AudioScrubberBar` already implements a quiet rail
  (play/pause, scrub, time, drag-to-seek) and is shown in `.audio`/video-hidden
  modes. Promote it to the single playback rail and make it present in
  `.video` mode too, rather than authoring a new control. Keep the video panel
  for the picture; move/duplicate transport into the rail.
- **Find logic is a testable model, not view code.** Add an `@Observable`
  `TranscriptFindModel` in `MacParakeetViewModels` that takes the segment array
  (or flowing text) + query and produces an ordered match list
  (`segmentIndex`, `Range`), `current`, `next()`, `prev()`. The view only
  highlights (`AttributedString`) and `scrollTo`. This keeps the matcher unit-
  testable and out of the god-file. Model the *field* on `SettingsSearchField`
  (capsule, ⌘F focus, results-as-you-type, clear button), but it is a new
  component (`TranscriptFindBar`) — no reusable FindBar exists today.
- **Hover actions reuse the established pattern** (`@State isHovering` +
  `DesignSystem.Animation.hoverTransition` 0.12s, opacity-gated, never reserve
  space at rest) used by dictation-history rows and chat bubbles. Add them to
  the segment row, not the timestamp chip.
- **Decompose opportunistically.** Each unit extracts exactly the slice it
  touches (segment row, reading pane) behind a characterization test, instead of
  a big-bang refactor of all 3,166 lines.

## High-level design

```
TranscriptResultView (shrinking shell: header card + tabs + action bar + layout)
│
├─ adaptiveLayout (.video split | .audio/.video-hidden | .none)
│   └─ PlaybackRail  ◀── U3: AudioScrubberBar, now present in ALL modes
│
└─ TranscriptReadingPane  ◀── U5 extraction target
    ├─ TranscriptFindBar         ◀── U2 (⌘F)  ── highlights + scrollTo
    │     observes TranscriptFindModel (MacParakeetViewModels)  ◀── U2 testable
    ├─ density / font-size control ◀── U4
    └─ TranscriptTimestampedContentView
          └─ TranscriptSegmentRow  ◀── U5 extraction + U1 hover actions
                (timestamp chip · text · hover: ▶ from here · ⧉ copy · ⧉+time)
```

Existing wiring to reuse verbatim: `MediaPlayerViewModel.seek(toMs:)`,
`.currentTimeMs` (10 Hz), `isSegmentActiveBinarySearch`, the `ScrollViewReader`
auto-scroll `onChange(currentTimeMs)`, and `formatTimestamp(ms:)`.

## Implementation units

Recommended order: **U1 → U4 → U2 → U3**, with **U5** extractions folded into
whichever unit first touches that slice. U1+U4 are Phase 1 (ship together,
view-only, low risk).

### U1. Per-segment hover actions
- **Goal:** On hover over a timestamped segment row, reveal three quiet actions:
  **Play from here**, **Copy text**, **Copy with timestamp**. Mirrors the
  audit's "play from here / copy text / copy with timestamp" line.
- **Dependencies:** none (seek + formatter already exist).
- **Files:** `TranscriptTimestampedContentView.swift` (segment + turn rows);
  new `Sources/MacParakeet/Views/Transcription/TranscriptSegmentRow.swift`
  (extract the per-segment row here — U5 slice); read pattern from
  `DictationHistoryView` hover rows.
- **Approach:** Add `@State isHovering`; gate a trailing `HStack` of borderless
  icon buttons with `.opacity(isHovering ? 1 : 0)` +
  `.animation(DesignSystem.Animation.hoverTransition, value: isHovering)`; do
  not reserve layout at rest. Wire: Play→`seek(toMs: startMs)` then play if
  paused (same as `onTimestampTap`); Copy→`segment.text`; Copy-with-timestamp→
  `"[\(formatTimestamp(ms: startMs))] \(segment.text)"`. Add `.help(...)`
  tooltips. Keep the existing tap-to-seek on the timestamp chip.
- **Patterns to follow:** dictation-history hover actions (Play/Copy/Menu on
  `.onHover`); `parakeetAction(.subtle)` or borderless icon buttons; coral only
  via tokens.
- **Test scenarios:** copy-with-timestamp string format; play-from-here calls
  `seek(toMs:)` with the row's `startMs`; hover actions hidden at rest (opacity
  0) and shown on hover; works in both speaker-turn and flat-segment layouts.
- **Verification:** `scripts/dev/run_app.sh`, open a YouTube/file transcript in
  Timed mode, hover a line, exercise all three actions; paste to confirm format.

### U4. Reading-density polish + font-size
- **Goal:** Calmer long-form reading (the audit warns the current card-per-line
  is too heavy) and an optional, persisted **A− / A+** font-size control.
- **Dependencies:** none; pairs naturally with U1 (same rows). Ships in Phase 1.
- **Files:** `TranscriptTimestampedContentView.swift` /
  `TranscriptSegmentRow.swift`; the transcript pane header in
  `TranscriptResultView.swift` (Text/Timed toggle area, ~1143–1215).
- **Approach:** Reduce per-row chrome for long reading (quieter background, keep
  the active-line highlight as the one strong accent; do **not** add a waveform
  or heavier cards). Add a small font-size stepper that scales the transcript
  body font from `DesignSystem.Typography.body/bodyLarge`; persist the choice in
  `UserDefaults` (one key, e.g. `transcriptFontScale`). Keep speaker color bands
  quiet (per audit).
- **Patterns to follow:** existing `transcriptDisplayMode` Text/Timed toggle;
  `DesignSystem.Typography` + spacing tokens.
- **Test scenarios:** font scale persists across view re-create; active-line
  highlight still the dominant accent at all scales.
- **Verification:** manual reading pass at min/default/max scale on a long
  (30k-word) transcript; confirm active-line still legible.

### U2. In-transcript find (⌘F)
- **Goal:** Search within the open transcript: a capsule find field, live match
  highlighting, "X of Y" counter, and next/prev (⌘G / ⇧⌘G), scrolling matches
  into view. Works in both Text and Timed modes.
- **Dependencies:** none functionally; cleaner *after* U5 extracts the reading
  pane so the find bar mounts on the pane, not the god-file.
- **Files:** new `Sources/MacParakeetViewModels/TranscriptFindModel.swift`
  (`@Observable`, testable matcher); new
  `Sources/MacParakeet/Views/Transcription/TranscriptFindBar.swift` (capsule
  field modeled on `SettingsSearchField`); mount in the reading pane; highlight
  in `TranscriptTimestampedContentView` + the flowing-text path.
- **Approach:** `TranscriptFindModel` takes `[TranscriptSegment]` (and the
  flat text for Text mode) + query → ordered `[Match(segmentIndex, Range)]`,
  case/diacritic-insensitive, with `current`, `next()`, `prev()`. View renders
  matches via `AttributedString` (background `accentLight`, current match a
  stronger `accent` underline/box), shows `current+1 / total`, and
  `proxy.scrollTo(matchSegmentId, anchor: .center)` on navigation — reuse the
  existing `ScrollViewReader`. ⌘F focuses; Esc clears then yields focus; respect
  the existing auto-scroll-pause so find-jumps don't fight playback follow.
- **Patterns to follow:** `SettingsSearchField` (focus/clear/⌘F, capsule with
  `surfaceElevated` + focused `accent.opacity(0.5)` border); existing
  `ScrollViewReader`/`scrollTo` in `TranscriptResultView`.
- **Test scenarios** (model-level, no GUI): match count for a known transcript;
  case/diacritic-insensitivity; next/prev wraparound; empty-query clears;
  multi-match-per-segment ordering.
- **Verification:** ⌘F in both Text and Timed modes; type, ⌘G through matches,
  confirm scroll + counter; Esc clears.

### U3. One quiet playback rail in every mode
- **Goal:** Make the persistent playback rail present in **video-split** mode
  too. Today transport is trapped inside `TranscriptionVideoPanel`; the
  `AudioScrubberBar` only appears in `.audio` / video-hidden layouts. Unify so
  there is always one quiet rail (IINA's lesson) and `.none` shows no transport.
- **Dependencies:** none, but it is the most layout-touching unit — do after the
  reading units land so regressions are isolated.
- **Files:** `TranscriptResultView.swift` `adaptiveLayout` (~261–283);
  `AudioScrubberBar.swift`; `TranscriptionVideoPanel.swift`.
- **Approach:** Promote `AudioScrubberBar` to a shared `PlaybackRail` shown
  beneath content in all playback modes except `.none`. In `.video` split mode,
  keep the video picture in the left pane but route transport (play/pause/scrub/
  time, and the existing PlaybackSpeed + subtitle toggles) into the shared rail
  so the frame stays clean. Verify the rail's enter/exit transition and the
  webm/opus transcode-then-play path are preserved.
- **Patterns to follow:** existing `AudioScrubberBar` slide-in transition
  (`.move(edge: .bottom).combined(with: .opacity)`); `playbackMode` switch.
- **Test scenarios:** rail visible+functional in `.video` and `.audio`, absent
  in `.none`; speed + subtitle toggles still reachable; seek from rail updates
  active-segment highlight + auto-scroll.
- **Verification:** `run_app.sh` across a YouTube video, a local `.mp4`, a local
  `.m4a`, and a meeting (`.none`); confirm transport parity and no dead controls.

### U5. God-file decomposition (enabling, behavior-preserving)
- **Goal:** Extract the slices the units above touch out of the 3,166-line
  `TranscriptResultView.swift`, each guarded by a characterization test first, so
  behavior is provably unchanged. Targets (from the structural map):
  `TranscriptSegmentRow.swift` (U1/U4), `TranscriptReadingPane.swift`
  (find + density + timestamped content host, U2/U4), and pure helpers
  (`activeSegmentIndex`/`autoScrollTarget`, speaker color/label maps) into a
  testable helper file.
- **Dependencies:** interleaved with U1/U2/U4 — extract the slice when first
  editing it; do not big-bang.
- **Files:** new `TranscriptSegmentRow.swift`, `TranscriptReadingPane.swift`,
  `TranscriptSegmentHelpers.swift`; trim `TranscriptResultView.swift`.
- **Approach:** Write a characterization test pinning current rendering/behavior
  (segment-active logic, scroll-target selection) *before* moving code; move with
  no behavior change; keep `@State` ownership and the View↔ViewModel boundary
  intact (the layout↔content split at ~262–283 is already a clean seam).
- **Test scenarios:** the extracted pure helpers (`activeSegmentIndex`,
  `autoScrollTarget`, speaker maps) get direct unit tests; a snapshot-ish
  characterization test ensures parity.
- **Verification:** full `swift test`; structural line-count drop on
  `TranscriptResultView.swift`; no behavior delta in manual QA.

## Acceptance examples

- **AE1.** In Timed mode, hovering a transcript line reveals ▶ / Copy /
  Copy-with-time; nothing is shown at rest; Copy-with-time yields
  `[12:03] …text…`. (U1)
- **AE2.** ⌘F opens a find field; typing highlights all matches and shows
  "3 / 17"; ⌘G scrolls to and emphasizes the next match; Esc clears. Works in
  both Text and Timed modes. (U2)
- **AE3.** Watching a YouTube transcript, a single quiet playback rail is visible
  with play/scrub/speed; the video frame has no separate control box; a meeting
  transcript (`.none`) shows no transport. (U3)
- **AE4.** A 30k-word transcript reads calmly; A+/A− changes body size and the
  choice survives reopening; the active line remains the one strong accent. (U4)
- **AE5.** `TranscriptResultView.swift` shrinks materially; `swift test` green;
  tap-to-seek, active-highlight, auto-scroll, and selection behave exactly as
  before. (U5)

## Risks and mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| U3 layout change regresses the `.video`/`.audio`/`.none` branches or the webm/opus transcode-then-play path | Do U3 last; manual matrix QA across all four source types; keep the existing slide transition; assert no transport in `.none`. |
| Find highlight (`AttributedString`) fights the active-segment highlight or auto-scroll | Keep active-line as a row-background accent and matches as inline text background; on find-navigate, set the existing `autoScrollPaused` so playback-follow doesn't yank the view. |
| God-file extraction silently changes behavior | Characterization test *before* each move; pure helpers get direct unit tests; behavior-preserving moves only. |
| Hover-only actions hurt discoverability / touch | Keep tap-to-seek on the chip as the always-visible primary; hover actions are additive; add `.help` tooltips. |
| Scope creep toward a Descript-style editor | Out-of-scope is explicit; this is a *reading* refresh, not editing. |

## Verification plan

- Per-unit: `swift build`; focused filters — e.g.
  `swift test --filter TranscriptFindModelTests`,
  `swift test --filter TranscriptSegment` (helpers).
- Before declaring done: full `swift test`, plus the Swift 6 no-Whisper gate
  build (see [[feedback_ci_swift6_language_mode_gate]]).
- Manual QA via `scripts/dev/run_app.sh` across **four** sources: YouTube URL,
  local `.mp4`, local `.m4a`, and a meeting transcript — exercise hover actions,
  ⌘F/⌘G, the rail, and font-size at each.
- Regression watch: tap-to-seek, active-line highlight, auto-scroll + 5s pause,
  and text selection must be unchanged.

## Deferred follow-up work

- **Word-level (karaoke) highlight** during playback — needs word-time data
  beyond `TranscriptSegment.startMs`; evaluate `wordTimestamps` coverage first.
- **Hover time-preview / thumbnail scrub** on the rail (IINA pattern) for long
  media.
- **Search-across-transcripts** (library/meetings-wide) — belongs to the
  meetings-workspace plan, not here.
- **Reusable `FindBar`** promoted app-wide (notes, meeting transcript) once
  `TranscriptFindBar` proves out.
