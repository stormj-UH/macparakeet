# Hacker News — Show HN

> **Status:** drafted, not posted. Needs an HN account.

## Why HN

Broad reach into the dev / startup / infra audience. People who run
homelabs, build agent stacks, run their own Mac mini for compute,
and care about local-first tooling. HN can be hostile to perceived
self-promotion, so the framing matters more than the content.

## Best practices (from the HN guidelines + observed patterns)

- **Do** lead with what it is in one sentence. No teaser titles.
- **Do** use the `Show HN:` prefix — required for project shares and
  invites a different reader posture.
- **Do** post on a weekday US morning (Pacific time roughly 8–11 a.m.)
  for best initial visibility.
- **Don't** ask for upvotes anywhere (in the post, in followups, in
  Twitter, in Discord). HN auto-flags this hard.
- **Don't** post the same blurb to multiple sites the same hour.
- **Don't** title with hype words. Avoid "fastest," "best,"
  "revolutionary."
- **Be present** in the comment thread for the first few hours. Top
  of the thread is the maintainer's engagement, not just the post.

## Title

```
Show HN: macparakeet-cli – local Parakeet STT on Apple Silicon for AI agents
```

(80 chars; HN soft-limit is 80 in the title field.)

## URL field

## First comment to post immediately after

The first-comment-by-the-author pattern works well on HN — it's a
chance to add context without making the title too dense. Post this
**immediately** after submitting:

Hi HN — Daniel, maintainer of MacParakeet here.

Quick context: this repo has had a macOS app (system-wide dictation, file transcription) since the start. The CLI used to feel internal; it is now a versioned public surface with semver, a written compatibility policy, stable JSON output on every read-only command, and a brew install path. Current release: `macparakeet-cli 2.3.1`.

The reason I'm doing the reframe is that Apple Silicon Mac minis are increasingly the home for personal AI agent daemons (OpenClaw, Hermes, custom shell loops). Voice / STT is the documented gap in that stack: Whisper.cpp doesn't use the Neural Engine, the OpenAI Whisper API breaks local-first, parakeet-mlx (Python) doesn't have a memory layer or prompts. `macparakeet-cli` is exactly the slot between those.

Architecture summary:

              ┌────────┴────────┐
              │ MacParakeetCore │   Swift library, no SwiftUI views

              └────────┬────────┘
                       │
            ┌──────────┴──────────┐
            ▼                     ▼
    macparakeet-cli         MacParakeet.app
    (semver 2.3.1)          (SwiftUI, GUI consumer)
```

The CLI is the load-bearing surface. The macOS app is one well-crafted client of it. Agent skills (OpenClaw, Hermes, generic shell automation) are other clients.

Everything is GPL-3.0. No accounts, no telemetry by default (opt-in, content-free, see <https://github.com/moona3k/macparakeet/blob/main/docs/telemetry.md>). The launch post with the full story is at <https://macparakeet.com/blog/macparakeet-cli-1-0/>; the agent-facing landing is at <https://macparakeet.com/agents>.

Happy to answer anything. Bug reports / feature requests filed on GitHub get a real human response.

## Things to expect in the thread

- **Comparisons to Whisper.cpp / WhisperKit** — be factual: WhisperKit is fine on the ANE; Parakeet TDT happens to be faster + lower-WER for English at the 0.6B size, plus FluidAudio runs both. Both are good.
- **"Why GPL not MIT?"** — link to <https://macparakeet.com/blog/macparakeet-open-source/> which addresses this directly. The short answer is: end-user app, want improvements to flow back. FluidAudio (Apache 2.0) is the embeddable layer.
- **Privacy questions** — answer factually: STT runs on-device ANE, DB local, no audio ever leaves device, optional cloud LLM only when explicitly configured.
- **"Will this work on Linux / x86 Mac?"** — no. Apple Silicon ANE is the entire premise. (For non-Apple-Silicon, parakeet-mlx + Python or Whisper.cpp are appropriate.)
- **Feature requests** — note in the answer if it's roadmap, not-roadmap, or unsure. "Simplicity is the product" is a real constraint.

## Things NOT to do in comments

- Don't pitch competing tools negatively.
- Don't post the same content again in replies.
- Don't paste the launch blog post body into comments — link.
- Don't engage with bait. The "this should be a Rust CLI" type comments are best replied to once with the technical reason and then ignored.

## After the post

- Keep an eye on the thread for ~2-3 hours after posting (peak engagement window).
- File any actionable feedback as GitHub issues with `from-hn` label.
- The HN URL becomes a permanent link to the conversation; it's worth referencing in future blog posts.
