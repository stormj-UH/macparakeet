# Library Multi-Select Bulk Cleanup

**Status:** SHIPPED IN PR #572 — archived 2026-07-16
**Date:** 2026-06-18
**ADRs:** none new (UI/data-flow change within existing Library architecture)
**Issues:** #498
**Decision (owner, 2026-06-18):** Reuse the existing Dictation History
explicit-selection pattern, with the Library/Meetings entry label **"Select
Many..."**, plus keyboard support (Delete key, ⌘A). Not Finder-style
modifier-click selection (keeps the app internally consistent).

## What this plan closes out

The Library has no way to remove more than one item at a time — every delete is a
context-menu → alert → confirm, one row at a time. #498 ("selecting multiple
items in Library to bulk delete") is the literal ask, and it compounds with the
#462 storage-management theme: users accumulating meetings/files need to prune in
bulk.

The good news: **Dictation History already implements a complete, shipped
bulk-select pattern** (selection state, mode toggle, an action bar with
count / Select Loaded / Clear / Delete, batched deletion). This plan ports that
proven pattern into the Library (both the thumbnail grid and the meetings list)
rather than inventing a new interaction — and layers on keyboard affordances
Dictation does not yet have. (No undo in v1 — see Out of scope for why a row-only
undo would be a data-loss trap here.)

This plan also creates the selection substrate that the **auto-title backlog**
follow-up (`2026-06-18-meeting-auto-title-followups.md`) rides on: once rows are
multi-selectable, "Generate titles" becomes a natural bulk action.

## Scope boundaries

### In scope
- Multi-select + bulk delete in **both** Library surfaces:
  the thumbnail grid (`TranscriptionLibraryView` grid mode) and the date-grouped
  meetings list (`TranscriptionLibraryView` meetings-list mode + `MeetingsView`
  "Recent Meetings").
- Selection state + batch-delete operations on `TranscriptionLibraryViewModel`,
  mirroring `DictationHistoryViewModel`'s API shape.
- An action bar (count, Select Loaded, Clear, Cancel, Delete Audio Only, Delete
  Items/Delete Meetings) consistent with the Dictation History bar.
- Keyboard: `⌫`/`Delete` triggers the bulk-delete confirmation when items are
  selected; `⌘A` selects all currently loaded filtered items; `Esc` exits select mode.
- Two bulk cleanup operations:
  - **Delete Items/Delete Meetings**: permanently removes the selected rows and
    app-owned assets.
  - **Delete Audio Only**: removes stored meeting audio only, keeping the
    meeting row and any transcript, notes, AI results, and chats.
- Confirmation alerts state the operation, eligible count, and permanence; copy
  adapts when the selection includes meetings (audio **and** AI summaries/chats
  are unrecoverable for full deletion — see Invariants).
- The batch operations run off the main thread (`Task.detached`), mirroring
  `DictationHistoryViewModel.deleteTargets`, so deleting many items never
  beachballs the UI. [Gemini]

### Out of scope
- Bulk delete in Dictation History (already exists).
- **Undo / trash for bulk delete.** Deferred for v1 by design: `delete(id:)`
  cascade-deletes a transcription's `prompt_results`, `chat_conversations`, and
  LLM-run rows (`foreignKeysEnabled` + `onDelete: .cascade`,
  `DatabaseManager.swift:227-229, 404-406, 807-810`), so a row-only undo would
  silently lose every AI summary and Ask-tab chat — strictly worse than no undo.
  A real undo needs a full-object-graph snapshot/restore or a soft-delete trash;
  both are a separate future feature. v1 relies on a precise confirmation instead.
- Bulk operations other than delete (move, export, favorite) — selection
  substrate enables them later, but only delete (+ the auto-title follow-up's
  "Generate titles") ships here.
- Repository-level batch SQL — loop the existing single deletes in the ViewModel
  (volumes are small; correctness + asset cleanup parity matter more than a new
  batch query). Revisit only if perf demands it.

### Invariants
- **Asset cleanup parity.** Each delete in the batch runs the *same*
  `TranscriptionDeletionCleanup.removeOwnedAssets()` + repo `delete(id:)` as the
  single-item path — no shortcut that skips on-disk cleanup.
- **Audio detach parity.** Bulk "Delete Audio Only" runs the same
  `TranscriptionAssetCleanup.detachOwnedMeetingAudio()` path as single-row
  "Delete Audio"; it never deletes the Library/Meetings row, transcript, or any
  notes, AI results, or chats that exist for that meeting.
- **No partial-silent failure.** If one item in the batch fails to delete, the
  batch continues and the result surfaces (count succeeded / failed), never a
  silent drop.
- **Deletion is permanent and total.** A full delete removes the row, transcript,
  on-disk audio, and any associated `prompt_results` / `chat_conversations` /
  LLM-run rows. There is no undo (see Out of scope), so the confirmation must
  state this plainly without implying optional meeting data always exists.
- **Audio-only is eligibility-counted.** When a mixed Library selection contains
  non-meetings or meetings without stored audio, "Delete Audio Only" affects
  only the selected meetings with available stored audio. The action label and
  confirmation state the eligible count and skipped count.
- **Filter-aware Select Loaded.** `⌘A` / "Select Loaded" selects only the
  currently loaded filtered + searched set, never hidden or unloaded rows.
- **Accessibility parity.** The action bar and selection controls carry VoiceOver
  labels (count, selected state, actions), consistent with the active a11y sprint.
- Idle hygiene: selection state is torn down on mode exit and on filter change.

## Verified current state (file:line)

- Reusable pattern (source of truth to mirror):
  `Sources/MacParakeetViewModels/DictationHistoryViewModel.swift`
  — `selectedDictationIDs: Set<UUID>` + `isBulkSelectionModeEnabled` (~104-111),
  `beginBulkSelection`/`exitBulkSelection` (~237-246),
  `requestDeleteSelectedDictations`/`confirmDeleteSelectedDictations` (~248-268),
  shared `deleteDictations(_:using:)` (~280-301), count-aware alert copy (~303-312).
- Action bar UI to mirror: `Sources/MacParakeet/Views/History/DictationHistoryView.swift`
  — `selectedActionsBar` (~173-220), Delete button (~208-214), bar shown when mode on (~83-89).
- Library views to modify:
  `Sources/MacParakeet/Views/Transcription/TranscriptionLibraryView.swift`
  — grid vs meetings-list routing (~75-79), filter chips (~44-57),
  `thumbnailGrid` (~137-160), `meetingsList` (~162-185),
  single-delete (context menu → `pendingDelete`, alert ~85-105 → `deleteTranscription`),
  meeting audio-only detach (~106-121 → `deleteMeetingAudio`).
- `Sources/MacParakeet/Views/Meetings/MeetingsView.swift` — "Recent Meetings"
  list reuses `MeetingRowCard` (~406-449).
- Library ViewModel to extend:
  `Sources/MacParakeetViewModels/TranscriptionLibraryViewModel.swift`
  — `transcriptions` / `filteredTranscriptions` / `groupedTranscriptions`,
  `deleteTranscription(_:)` (~152-165) calling
  `TranscriptionDeletionCleanup.removeOwnedAssets()` + repo `delete(id:)`;
  `deleteMeetingAudio(_:)` (~167-188). No selection state today.
- `MeetingsWorkspaceViewModel` delegates recents to a `TranscriptionLibraryViewModel`
  (`recentMeetingsViewModel`) — selection lives in that VM so both surfaces share it.
- Delete cascade: `TranscriptionRepository.delete(id:)` (~357) is a bare
  `Transcription.deleteOne` and the DB has `foreignKeysEnabled = true` with
  `prompt_results`, `chat_conversations`, and the LLM-run table all
  `references("transcriptions", onDelete: .cascade)`
  (`DatabaseManager.swift:31, 227-229, 404-406, 807-810`) — so a delete takes the
  AI content with it. This is why undo is out of scope.
- No undo anywhere today (deletes are permanent).

## Design

### Visual treatment and color
- **Selection color:** use `DesignSystem.Colors.accent` / `accentLight` for
  selected rows/cards and checkmarks. This matches the app's coral-orange action
  language and the Library filter chips.
- **Destructive color:** reserve `DesignSystem.Colors.errorRed` and
  `.parakeetAction(.destructive)` for the actual destructive actions:
  `Delete Audio Only...`, `Delete Items...`, `Delete Meetings...`, and
  confirmation buttons.
- **Do not use red for selection state.** Selection is a reversible staging mode;
  making selected rows red would make the whole surface feel like data is already
  being destroyed.
- **Do not introduce a new selection hue.** The sidebar's blue is system/sidebar
  selection; Library content selection should stay in the product's coral system.
- Grid cards: selected state gets a subtle `accentLight` wash, a 1-1.5pt accent
  stroke, and a filled checkmark circle. Avoid heavy fills that compete with
  thumbnails.
- Meeting/list rows: selected state gets a leading checkmark circle plus a low
  opacity accent row background. Keep hover visually subordinate to selected.

### ViewModel (mirror Dictation, adapt to Transcription)
On `TranscriptionLibraryViewModel`:
```swift
public private(set) var isBulkSelectionModeEnabled: Bool
public private(set) var selectedTranscriptionIDs: Set<UUID>
public var pendingBulkOperation: BulkTranscriptionOperation?
func beginBulkSelection(startingWith: Transcription?)
func toggleSelection(_ id: UUID)
func selectAllVisible()                              // filtered + searched only
func clearSelection()
func exitBulkSelection()
func requestDeleteSelectedItems()
func requestDeleteSelectedMeetingAudio()
func confirmPendingBulkOperation() async -> BulkOperationResult   // {succeeded, failed, skipped}
```
- `BulkTranscriptionOperation` snapshots the selected rows at confirmation time:
  `.deleteItems([Transcription])` or
  `.deleteAudioOnly(targets: [Transcription], skipped: Int)`.
- `confirmPendingBulkOperation` runs the per-item cleanup in a `Task.detached`
  loop (off the main actor), accumulates `{succeeded, failed, skipped}`, and exits
  mode after a confirmed operation. No undo in v1.

### Interaction
- **Entry:** a row context-menu item "Select Many…", plus a toolbar "Select
  Many" affordance on the Library header.
- **Selection:** tapping a row toggles its checkmark while in mode; grid cards
  show a selection overlay, list rows a leading checkbox.
- **Action bar:** appears at the bottom while in mode — `N selected ·
  Select Loaded · Clear · Cancel · Delete Audio Only… · Delete Items…`.
- **Meetings action bar:** in meeting-only contexts (`Library` Meetings filter
  and `MeetingsView` Recent Meetings), show the destructive choices plainly:
  `Delete Audio Only…` and `Delete Meetings…`.
- **Mixed Library action bar:** always show `Delete Items…`. Show
  `Delete Audio Only…` only when at least one selected meeting has stored
  audio; label it with the eligible count where space allows, e.g.
  `Delete Audio for 3 Meetings…`.
- **Keyboard:** `⌘A` select loaded visible rows, `⌫`/`Delete` → confirmation,
  `Esc` → exit. (Use SwiftUI `.onKeyPress` / commands on the focused Library
  view; verify focus behavior in the dev app.)
- **Confirmation copy (no undo, so it must be precise):**
  - full delete, files only: *"Delete N items? This permanently deletes the
    Library rows and app-owned files. Original local source files are not
    removed."*
  - full delete, includes meetings: *"Delete N items, including M meetings? This
    permanently removes the selected rows, transcripts, stored audio, and any
    notes, AI results, or chats for those meetings."*
  - audio-only: *"Delete audio for M meetings? Transcripts, notes, AI results,
    and chats stay in Library if they exist. Playback and retranscription will be
    unavailable unless you saved a copy."*

## Phases
1. **ViewModel selection + bulk operation model + tests** — port the Dictation
   API onto `TranscriptionLibraryViewModel`; off-main-thread (`Task.detached`)
   full delete and audio-only detach; unit tests for select-loaded-visible
   (respects filter/search and pagination), success/partial-failure/skipped
   result, mode teardown.
2. **Grid + list UI** — selection overlays/checkboxes, action bar (with VoiceOver
   labels); both surfaces; full-delete row menu parity in `MeetingsView`.
3. **Keyboard** — ⌘A / Delete / Esc; dev-app verification of focus + that Delete
   doesn't fire when not in select mode.
4. **Docs** — `spec/04-ui-patterns.md` (Library multi-select) and
   `spec/02-features.md`.

## Testing
- ViewModel unit tests: selection toggling, `selectAllVisible` excludes
  filtered-out/searched-out/unloaded rows, full delete returns correct
  succeeded/failed, audio-only detach returns correct succeeded/failed/skipped,
  off-main-thread execution, mode teardown clears state.
- Asset-cleanup parity test: a batch delete invokes the same cleanup as the
  single-item path (no orphaned files; meeting folders removed).
- Audio-only parity test: selected meeting audio detach keeps the transcription
  row and clears `filePath`, while selected non-meetings or meetings without
  audio are skipped and reported.
- `swift test` before merge. (SwiftUI views themselves untested per repo policy —
  logic lives in the ViewModel.)

## Open questions (resolve in Phase 1)
1. **Favorites in Select Loaded:** include favorited rows in `⌘A` (simplest) vs.
   warn/exclude. Lean: include, but the confirmation count makes scale visible.
2. **Toolbar "Select Many" vs. context-menu-only entry:** ship both for discoverability,
   or context-menu-only to match Dictation exactly? Lean: both.

(Resolved during PR #556 review: no undo/trash in v1 — a row-only undo would lose
cascade-deleted AI summaries/chats; rely on a precise confirmation. The batch
delete runs off the main thread.)
