/// voiced-like *tones*, not speech. So the gate asserts only on the axes the
/// fixture measures reliably — far-end echo removal (ERLE) and near-end *energy*
/// retention — and reports overlap-segment accuracy using the harness's existing
/// near-end error metric at 0/+6/+12 dB SIR. This is the synthetic equivalent of
/// double-talk WER: it is computed only where local speech overlaps reference
/// playback. It is still not a substitute for real-speech WER, because a neural
/// model trained on real speech reshapes synthetic tones in ways that penalize
/// exact-waveform error whether or not it would damage real speech. Real
/// speaker-mode QA (plan unit U9) owns fidelity and remains the binding gate
