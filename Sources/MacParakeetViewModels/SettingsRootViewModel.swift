/// - `activeTab` — currently visible tab; persisted across launches via
///   UserDefaults so a user who lives in System (e.g. while auditing
///   permissions) returns there on next launch.
/// - `searchQuery` — top-of-panel search text; non-empty switches the panel
///   into flat-results mode.
///
/// Intentionally **does not** own per-tab state. Sub-VMs (`Modes`, `Engine`,
/// `AI`, `System`) will be wired in subsequent commits and addressed by the
/// parent view, not stored here. Keeping this VM small is the explicit
/// remedy for the 1,265-line god-object pattern that motivated the split.
