/// Live-preview chunker that cuts at VAD speech boundaries instead of fixed
/// 5-second windows. See
/// `plans/completed/2026-05-meeting-vad-guided-live-chunking.md`.
///
/// **Contiguous sample accounting.** Chunks tile the recording with no gaps in
/// the audio they emit, so `lastEmittedSample` always equals the absolute
/// sample index of `buffer[0]`, and therefore `chunk.startMs` always equals the
/// true absolute position of the chunk's first sample.
/// `MeetingTranscriptAssembler` dedups live words by absolute `endMs`, so a
/// `startMs` that understated the position would silently drop early words from
/// the preview. Contiguous accounting makes that impossible.
///
/// **Lockstep buffering.** Incoming samples are staged in `pendingVAD` and only
/// moved into the emittable `buffer` once they have been fed to VAD in exact
/// `VadManager.chunkSize` windows. So `buffer` only ever holds *VAD-examined*
/// audio, and the force-emit / silence-drop decisions (which key off
/// `buffer.count`) can never act on samples VAD has not analyzed — even for an
/// arbitrarily large single ingest.
///
/// Silence between utterances becomes leading silence of the next chunk (minor
/// STT cost, no correctness cost). The only deliberate overlap is a short tail
/// re-fed after a forced (max-duration) cut, because that cut lands mid-word;
/// the assembler's dedup harmlessly discards the duplicated tail words.
///
/// **Concurrency.** Methods mutate `buffer`/`pendingVAD` across `await` points
/// (the `vad.processStreamingChunk` hop), so a *second* concurrent caller would
/// interleave and corrupt that state. Being an actor does **not** prevent this —
/// actors are reentrant across `await`. Safety instead comes from there being
/// exactly one caller in flight: `MeetingRecordingService` drains the capture
/// stream with a single `for await event in events` task
/// (`MeetingRecordingService.swift`), so `CaptureOrchestrator.ingest` — and
/// therefore each chunker's `addSamples`/`flush`/`reset` — is only ever invoked
/// one at a time. `configureChunkers`/`reset` (start) and `flush*` (stop) run
/// outside that task's active window. If capture is ever parallelized per source
/// (e.g. a `TaskGroup` or per-source tasks), this invariant breaks and the
/// chunker needs its own serialization.
///
/// This type does not depend on FluidAudio — it round-trips the opaque
/// `MeetingVADStreamState` through a `MeetingVoiceActivityDetecting`.
