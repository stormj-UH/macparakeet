/// Estimates the bulk delay between the system-audio reference and the echo it

///
/// Why this exists: the meeting measurement harness showed that reference/mic
/// time alignment is the dominant factor in whether cancellation works at all,
/// and that the bulk offset between the microphone clock and the ScreenCaptureKit
/// system-audio clock can be far larger than any practical adaptive filter can
/// span. A fixed `referenceDelaySamples` cannot track that. This recovers the
/// bulk delay from the audio itself; the downstream adaptive/neural filter then
/// only has to model the residual room response within its own length.
///
/// Method: a pre-emphasized normalized cross-correlation search. Pre-emphasis
/// (a one-tap high-pass) flattens the steep spectral tilt of speech so the
/// correlation peak is sharp rather than smeared; normalization makes the peak a
/// scale-independent confidence so a weak/absent echo can be rejected rather than
/// snapping to a spurious lag. The search is bulk-delay only (non-negative lags,
/// since echo always trails the played reference); sub-sample precision is left
/// to the adaptive filter, which absorbs a few samples of residual error.
