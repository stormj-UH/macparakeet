# ADR-013: Prompt Library + Multi-Summary Architecture

> Status: **Accepted**
> Date: 2026-04-03
> Related: ADR-011 (LLM providers), spec/12-processing-layer.md, ADR-022 (Transforms)
> Implementation Note (2026-04-04): The current implementation seeds built-in/community prompts from `Prompt.builtInPrompts()` in Swift. `community-prompts.json` exists as a contribution/reference artifact, but runtime JSON loading has not shipped.
> Naming Note (2026-04-28): The database table remains `summaries`, but the Swift model/repository/view-model names are now `PromptResult`, `PromptResultRepository`, and `PromptResultsViewModel`.
> Transform Note (2026-05-13): ADR-022 now uses `Prompt.Category.transform` for productized Transforms. The Prompt Library serves summaries and Transforms today; workflow steps remain future work.

## Context

MacParakeet's LLM summary feature (spec/11 §1) uses a single hardcoded system prompt and stores one summary per transcript (`transcriptions.summary` column). Users have requested control over how summaries are generated — different transcript types (meetings, lectures, podcasts) need different summarization approaches ([GitHub issue #51](https://github.com/moona3k/macparakeet/issues/51)).

The feature request also revealed a broader need: users want to run multiple different prompts against the same transcript and keep all the results. A meeting transcript might need both "Meeting Notes" and "Action Items" summaries simultaneously.

Additionally, this feature is the first building block for a future processing layer — configurable workflows that chain LLM prompts, CLI commands, exports, and webhooks (inspired by [VoiceInk PR #600](https://github.com/Beingpax/VoiceInk/pull/600) by @mitsuhiko and MacParakeet's own Local CLI transport in PR #47).

## Decision

### 1. Prompt Library stored in SQLite

Reusable prompt templates are stored in the `prompts` table (not UserDefaults). Each prompt has a name, content, category, visibility flag, and auto-run flag; ADR-022 adds nullable `keyboardShortcut` and `runningLabel` columns for Transform prompts. Built-in/community prompts are currently seeded from Swift constants in `Prompt.builtInPrompts()`. The JSON file at `Sources/MacParakeetCore/Resources/community-prompts.json` is kept as a contribution/reference artifact, not the active runtime seed source. Built-in/community summary prompts can be hidden but not edited or deleted. Built-in Transform prompts can be reset but otherwise use the Transforms UI rules from ADR-022. Custom prompts support full CRUD.

The table is named `prompts` (not `summary_presets`) because the model is general-purpose — the same table serves summaries and Transforms today, and can serve workflow steps later. A `category` enum field (`.summary`, `.transform`) scopes prompts to their use case.

### 2. Multiple summaries per transcript

Each transcript can have multiple summaries, stored in a new `summaries` table with a one-to-many relationship to `transcriptions`. This follows the same pattern as multi-conversation chat (`chat_conversations` table, introduced in v0.5).

Generating a summary appends a new record and preserves earlier results, even when the same prompt is used with different per-run instructions. Regenerate is the only replacement path: it replaces the specific summary the user chose, and only after the new result has been durably saved. Users navigate between summaries via tabs on the summary screen.

### 3. Prompt snapshots on summaries

Each summary record stores a snapshot of the prompt name and content used to generate it (not a foreign key reference to the `prompts` table). This ensures summaries are self-contained — editing or deleting a prompt after generation doesn't break or change the summary's metadata.

### 4. Compact prompt chips inside a popover

The prompt selector lives inside a dedicated summary-generation popover and uses compact chips rather than a dropdown because:
- it keeps the main transcript/summaries surface focused on content, not controls
- visible prompts are directly tappable without opening nested menus
- prompt management can live alongside the chips in the same popover
- a wrapped layout still scales to a modest prompt set without taking over the main pane

### 5. Summary generation is queued, not parallel

Users can queue multiple summary requests from the same transcript, but the app runs only one summary stream at a time. Additional requests appear immediately as queued tabs and start automatically when the active generation finishes.

This preserves the responsive UX of “let me ask for several summaries now” without the reliability and state complexity of parallel LLM streaming.

### 6. Auto-run uses selected prompt cards

Auto-run after transcription uses every prompt card marked `isAutoRun = true`. This is user-configurable in the prompt library rather than fixed to the first built-in prompt.

Zero auto-run prompt cards is a valid state. In that configuration, transcription still completes normally, chat remains available, and users add prompt tabs manually from the summary UI.

## Rationale

### Why SQLite for prompts (not UserDefaults)?

All other user-managed data in MacParakeet (dictations, transcriptions, custom words, text snippets, chat conversations) lives in SQLite via GRDB. Prompts follow the same pattern for consistency, testability (in-memory SQLite), and query capability. The established repository protocol pattern (e.g., `CustomWordRepository`) maps directly.

### Why multi-summary (not overwrite)?

The single-summary model forces users to choose: "Do I want Meeting Notes or Action Items?" With multi-summary, the answer is "both." This aligns with the broader vision of transcripts as raw material that can be processed through multiple lenses. The implementation cost is modest — the `chat_conversations` table already proves the one-to-many pattern.

### Why a queue (not parallel generation)?

True parallel streaming would require multiple live LLM tasks, multiple temporary tab states, more cancellation and replacement edge cases, and more difficult testing. A queue preserves the important UX property — users can keep asking for more summaries immediately — while keeping execution deterministic and the implementation much safer.

### Why snapshots (not foreign keys)?

A prompt is a living document — users edit and refine their custom prompts over time. A summary should always accurately reflect what produced it. If a prompt is edited next week, existing summaries generated with the old version should still show the original prompt. This is the same reason git stores snapshots, not diffs.

### Why not build the full workflow engine now?

The three-layer architecture (Prompts → Actions → Workflows) is the long-term vision, but building a workflow engine is a massive scope increase that requires: action type definitions, an execution engine, inter-step state passing, error handling per step, and a workflow builder UI. The Prompt Library is the foundation that makes all of this possible later, without any premature abstraction. See spec/12-processing-layer.md for the full layered design.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Users get control over summary generation without complexity for the default case
- Multiple summaries per transcript supports real workflows (meeting notes + action items)
- Prompt Library is general-purpose — serves summaries and Transforms now, with workflow reuse left for later
- Data model follows established patterns (GRDB, protocol-based repos, @Observable VMs)
- Prompt snapshots make summaries self-contained and reproducible
- Migration from existing single-summary data is clean (same pattern as chatMessages → chat_conversations)

### Negative

- **More storage:** Multiple summaries per transcript uses more database space than a single column. Minimal impact — summary text is small compared to transcript text.
- **UI complexity:** The summary tab gains a generation popover, tab navigation, and queued states. Mitigated by keeping execution single-worker and the controls compact.
- **Migration required:** Existing `transcriptions.summary` data must migrate to the new `summaries` table. One-time, follows the proven v0.5 migration pattern.
- **PromptResultsViewModel extraction:** Summary logic moves out of TranscriptionViewModel into a dedicated PromptResultsViewModel. More files, but cleaner separation (follows TranscriptChatViewModel precedent).
